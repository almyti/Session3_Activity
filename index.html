            <header>Who are the Four Emperors in One Piece?</header>
            <p>The Four Emperors, which make up one of the Three Great Powers, are a group of four pirates considered to be the most notorious and powerful captains in the world. Currently, the Emperors are Red-Haired Shanks, Blackbeard, Straw Hat Luffy, and Buggy the Star Clown; Whitebeard, Big Mom, and Kaidou of the Beasts are the former known members.</p>
            <p>The Four Emperors are not typically allies, nor are they strictly enemies of one another. Rather, the four prefer to remain autonomous under most circumstances. The Emperors have historically individually resided within the second half of the Grand Line (known as the "New World"), exerting impressive influence and control over dozens of other pirate crews and self-governing islands. Compared to antagonistic individuals and groups the Straw Hat Pirates face earlier in the series, the Emperors serve as a far bigger threat during the second half of the One Piece series (most notably in the Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga, where Big Mom and Kaidou serve as the respective main antagonists).</p>
            <p>In the decisive Summit War of Marineford, Whitebeard met his end towards the climax of the war. Although Kaidou wished to attack Whitebeard before the war, he was stopped by Shanks, who then arrived at Marineford and insisted on a ceasefire. Whitebeard's former subordinate and murderer, Blackbeard, subsequently usurped his position within the following year after the Payback War.</p>
            <p>Two years after the war in Marineford, following the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc, the World Economy News Paper referred to Monkey D. Luffy as standing adjacent to the Four Emperors as the "Fifth Emperor" of the sea. This was both due to the events of the arc and interviews performed with Cavendish and Bartolomeo, who informed the journalists of the 5,640-member Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Then, after the respective defeats of both Kaidou and Big Mom at the end of the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy and Buggy were publicized as new Emperors to replace them.</p>
